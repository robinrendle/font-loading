# font-loading

## Demos for font loading techniques.

These demos are designed to show the various differences between font loading techniques, but theyâ€™re certainly not an exhaustive documentation on each technique so make sure to check the `readme` of each example for more information.

This repo can be used as a place to log interesting edge cases for each particular technique or as a place to warn others of certain problems. Again, this is not an official reposity of the codebase for each of these techniques so these warnings will only act as flags or signposts in all the font loading confusion.


## About the examples

These examples only rely on markup and inline scripts to help serve as a tutorial. There are probably better ways in which to integrate these techniques into your particular project, such as with a module loader.
