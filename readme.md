# ❡ Web font loading

These demos are designed to show the various differences between font loading techniques, but they’re certainly not designed to be the last port of call, so make sure to check the `readme` of each example for more information.

This repo can be used as a place to log interesting edge cases, or as a place to warn others of certain problems.


## About the examples

These examples only rely on markup and inline scripts to help serve as a tutorial. There are probably better ways in which to integrate these techniques into your particular project, such as with a module loader.
