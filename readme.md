# ‚ù° Web font loading

A collection of demos to show the differences between font loading techniques.

This repo can be used as a place to log interesting edge cases, or as a place to warn others of certain problems. If you find something strange then be sure to add an issue.


## About the examples

These examples only rely on markup and inline scripts to help serve as a tutorial. There are definitely better ways in which to integrate these techniques into your project, such as with a module loader.
